## User Story

### Acceptance Criteria for Minimum Viable Product

GIVEN an application that contains a form for creating a user:

- WHEN loading the app,
  THEN display a form with the following fields; firstName, lastName, emailAddress, password, company, jobTitle, jobFunction, state, and city
- WHEN the form displays,
  THEN allow the user to complete and submit the form
- WHEN the user presses the submit button,
  THEN do not allow the form to submit to the API endpoint until the user completes the entire form
- WHEN the form submits to the API endpoint,
  THEN provide feedback to the user on the status of the submission to the API endpoint

---

## Features

- The "Job Function" and "State" select fields are populated with options from an API endpoint. The data from that API endpoint is sorted alphabetically and scrubbed for repeated terms prior to generating the options dropdown.
- The application provides feedback as the user is filling in the form if any validation rules are violated. It also checks the entire form once submitted to ensure no requirements are violated prior to submitting the information to the API endpoint.
- Submission success or error messages are provided at the bottom of the form once the form is submitted.
